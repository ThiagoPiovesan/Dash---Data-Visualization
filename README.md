### Original text:

In this video series, I show you how to set up data visualization using Plotly Dash in Python in a few easy steps. This is a three-part miniseries. In part 1, I show the basics of Dash. In part 2 I dive more deeply into loading, filtering and displaying data. And finally in part 3, I cover a few ways to improve the design and make the application more ready for production.

Video part 3: coming soon.

## Running the app

Run the following commands and open the local host web address chosen by Dash.

```shell
python ./main.py
```

An example of the expected terminal messages are shown below:

```shell
Dash is running on http://127.0.0.1:8050/

 * Serving Flask app 'app' (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: on
```
